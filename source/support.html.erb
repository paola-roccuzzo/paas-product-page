      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">How GOV.UK PaaS is supported</h1>

      <p>
        GOV.UK PaaS is supported 24 hours a day, seven days a week by the team
        that builds it.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this page you can find out about the support we provide during and
        outside of working hours, and how you can contact us to report a problem
        or ask for help.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Support during working hours</h2>

      <p>
        Our office hours are 9am - 5pm Monday to Friday. During this time we
        support:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>requests for help using GOV.UK PaaS</li>
        <li>fixing issues and resolving incidents</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We prioritise support for live services over those in development, and
        fixing issues with the platform over answering user queries. For more
        information on how we respond to requests, you can look at our platform
        documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        For help using GOV.UK PaaS or to report a problem with your service,
        email us at
        <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">
          gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
        </a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Support outside of working hours</h2>

      <p>
        Between 5pm and 9am Monday to Friday, at weekends, and during Bank
        Holidays we provide emergency support for critical incidents affecting
        live production services. A critical incident is where:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          your application is unavailable due to a problem with our platform
        </li>
        <li>
          you can’t make a critical upgrade to your application because the
          GOV.UK PaaS API isn’t available
        </li>
        <li>
          you are experiencing a critical issue with your application that you
          cannot resolve without help from the platform team.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We’ll start working on the issue within 40 minutes and email you to
        let you know. We’ll address anything that is not a critical incident
        the next working day.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Contacting us about a critical issue</h2>

      <p>
        To contact us about a critical issue during working hours, please use
        our support email address,
        <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">
          gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
        </a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To contact us outside of working hours, please use the emergency email
        address you have been given. This will raise a high priority alert and
        could wake us up in the middle of the night, so it should only be used
        for critical incidents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do not share this email address with people outside of your
        team.
      </p>
