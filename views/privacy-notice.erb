			<h1 class="heading-large">Privacy Notice</h1>
			<p class="summary">Date last modified: 26/04/2018</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Who we are</h2>
			<p>GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part of the Cabinet Office. Our job is the digital transformation of government.</p>
			<p>We are a centre of excellence in digital, technology and data, collaborating with departments to help them with their own transformation. We work with them to build platforms, standards and digital services.</p>
			<p>The GOV.UK PaaS is a cloud hosting platform for use by government departments, agencies and crown bodies. Our users can deploy their services to the cloud in a secure and cost-efficient manner. We refer to our users as ‘tenants’, to avoid confusion with the end users accessing the service hosted on the platform.</p>
			<p>The data controller for GDS is the Cabinet Office – a data controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. For more information see the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/esdwebpages/search" data-click-events data-click-category="Content" data-click-action="External link clicked">Data Protection Public Register</a>.
