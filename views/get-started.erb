				This is a typical journey for building a public-facing service with an in-house development team.
				It assumes you&apos;re building according to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Digital Service Standard</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Service Manual</a>.

				<p>Work through the <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#quick-setup-guide">‘Quick Setup Guide’</a> to deploy your first static site to test your connection. Read the orientation guide for your language to understand what PaaS already does for you.</p>
				<p>Push some sample code for your project:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet">
					<li>Use the platform marketplace to request “trial plan” <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#deploy-a-backing-or-routing-service">services such as databases</a></li>
					<li>Bind the services to your apps with the command line, then get your app to look at environment variables so it can <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#accessing-the-service-from-your-app">connect to the services</a>.</li>
					<li>Make any other similar changes to your code to fit with the “12 factor app” principles for cloud scalability</li>
					<li>Read our <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#troubleshooting-2">troubleshooting documentation</a> to help you overcome any problems</li>
					<li>Raise tickets with <a href="/support">support</a> if needed</li>

					<li>Configure each environment with the proper backing services; these are often small and open in integration, but high-availability and encrypted in production</li>
					<li>Turn on <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#scaling">extra instances</a> of key apps in production to get high availability</li>
					<li>Continue development, trying out backing services and app ideas on a pay-as-you-go basis</li>

					<li>Add features to integrate with any legacy APIs</li>
